# User Management Backend (Go)

This project is a backend service developed using Go to manage user data where the age is calculated dynamically from the date of birth instead of being stored.

The implementation focuses on clean project structure, clear separation of responsibilities, and reliable data handling.

---

## Project Overview

The application stores user information, including date of birth, in a MySQL database.  
Rather than persisting age, it is computed at runtime whenever user data is retrieved, ensuring accuracy over time.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Fiber)** – backend framework  
- **MySQL** – relational database  
- **SQLC** – type-safe database access  
- **go-playground/validator** – request validation  
- **Uber Zap** – structured logging

The structure is designed to keep responsibilities clearly separated and the codebase easy to maintain.

## Database Design

The application uses a single `users` table with the following fields:

- `id` – primary key  
- `name` – user name  
- `dob` – date of birth  

The user’s age is **not stored** in the database.  
It is calculated dynamically using Go’s `time` package.

## Setup Summary

For this project:

- Go (version 1.21 or higher) was installed  
- MySQL was installed and configured  
- Required environment variables were set  
- Database schema was applied using migration files  

**Key Highlights:**

- Dynamic age calculation without storing redundant data  
- Type-safe database interactions using SQLC  
- Input validation at the API boundary  
- Structured logging for better observability  
- Clean separation between HTTP, service, and data layers

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Backend development using Go  
- MySQL database integration  
- Clean and maintainable project architecture  
- Practical implementation of backend best practices  

API functionality was tested locally using Postman.  
The server runs locally and handles all user-related operations.

## Running the Application

After completing the setup, the application was started using:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
